# British Airways Virtual Job Sim - Data Science
Completed through The Forage (https://www.theforage.com/)

## 🎯 Project Overview
British Airways faced operational inefficiencies at Heathrow Terminal 3 due to unpredictable lounge demand and low conversion rates in digital sales. Ground teams lacked a scalable way to forecast premium passenger volume, while the marketing department was overspending on low-intent "browsers.". I developed a scalable demand-forecasting model for lounge capacity at Heathrow Terminal 3 and engineered a high-performance predictive pipeline to identify high-intent booking behaviours within a 50,000-record dataset.  

## 🛠️ Skills & Tools
* **Operational Modeling:** Demand Forecasting, Capacity Planning, Customer Segmentation.
* **Machine Learning:** Random Forest Classifier, SMOTE (Class Imbalance), Feature Engineering (Ratio Analysis).
* **Data Science:** Python (Pandas, Scikit-learn), Advanced Excel (Lookup Logic).

## 📈 Key Tasks & Contributions
1. **Task 1:** - Modeling lounge eligibility at Heathrow Terminal 3.
2. **Task 2:** - Predicting customer buying behaviour.

# 🏁 Final Conclusion
Successfully delivered a scalable ground-operations model that identifies "Long Haul - Peak Business" flows as requiring 25% lounge capacity, paired with a predictive sales engine achieving 91% recall and 98% accuracy. This dual-phase approach optimizes airport resource allocation while identifying high-intent customers for a 10–20% potential uplift in booking conversion through targeted re-marketing. The model achieved a 98% model accuracy and a 91% recall, identifying Purchase Lead Time as the primary conversion driver to optimize marketing ROI.
